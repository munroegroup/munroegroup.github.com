There are many web savvy technologists, developers, and other tinkerers out
there that come to a point in time where they need to create a web site or
design an app and want it to look nice, but they do not want to pay for a
template already created or pay more to hire a designer to create a design for
them. Here are some design philosophies, tips/tricks, and guidelines to follow
in helping with your design.

## 7 Principles ##

1. Alignment 
    1. make sure that things align with each other, horizontally and vertically
    2. use a grid to hep with this
2. Emphasis – try to pull the users eye to one focal point
3. Hierarchy – how objects relate to one another, decide what to emphasise and
provide order to objects
4. Consistency – similar parts should be expressed in similar ways
5. White space – manage active (deliberately used to space objects) and passive
white space (empty space around outside of design)
6. Balance – all elements should be in optical equlibrium
7. Unity – all items work together within the overall design

As noted already, use a grid system to help deliver on some of these principles.
A grid is priceless in helping with alignment, consistency, and balance. The
constraints of a grid can help foster creativity and a 12 unit grid is your
friend.

## Sketching ##

When starting your design off, sketch. Set a goal for the user of the design and
start sketching thoughts on a design that meets that goal. Sketch more, and then
sketch some more. Print out at least 10 pages of sketch sheets you can find
online to fit the constraints you are designing within. At first, do more
brainstorm type sketches by just letting your hands roam. Do a quick and dirty
sketch, then move on to another. Create a bunch of these. Don’t erase anything,
just keep sketching. Each sketch should only take about 30 seconds to a minute.
Keep going until you have a lot of ideas explored. Take a step back and look
over the sketches you have made. Pick some that stick out and start digging
deeper on those ideas by creating some more detailed sketches where you spend
whatever time is required to flush out the idea more fully. Sometime you may
have an object that requires a lot of detail within your sketch that you can
break out into other brainstorm, then more detailed sketches. If you are not
sketching now, change that. I think you will be surprised how helpful and how
many new ideas and breakthroughs in design that it leads to. Sketches are
rudimentary, don’t feel like you can’t sketch just because you didn’t attend
RISD.

## Typography ##

The web is 95% typography. Most of what is seen online is type. A lot of people
rush off and start picking colors or cool graphics for their site and pick any
old type and run with it. Type is one of the most important details in your
design, if not the most important.

Some common fonts that work great online are Helvetica, Georgia, Verdana, Lucide
Grande and Times New Roman. The issue with Times New Roman is that it has been
used so often. Helvetica tends to still look good when used with a bigger font
size. If the font size gets real big and the letter spacing gets out of control,
you can add a -1 letter spacing style to help with that. Georgia and Verdana
tend to work well on low resolution screens.

Find some fonts that fit your style and build a library of fonts you will use in
your designs. Getting to know your fonts and how they look/interact with
different sizes and emphasis can be really helpful. When designing, try to stay
with one font at first and sprinkle in, maybe one other for contrast. Mixing a
Serif font with a Sans Serif font works well for contrast.

## Color ##

color wheel

* primary
  * red
  * yellow
  * blue
* secondary
  * green
  * orange
  * purple
* cool – calm, stable
  * green
  * blue
  * purple
* warm – energetic, grab attention
  * yellow
  * orange
  * red
* neutral
  * black
  * white
  * brown
  * gray
* complimentary – colors across from each other on the color wheel
* analagous – colors next to each other on the color wheel

Only use one, sometimes two dominant colors. If you use two, make sure that they
have contrast.

Colors have meaning and can invoke certain feelings:

* blue – confidence, stability, professional, honor, trust
* green – growth, wealth, optimism, harmony
* red – power, love, violence, evil, danger, emergency, strength, courage
* yellow – joy, hope, excitement, warning
* white – purity, cleanliness, innocence, softness, weddings
* black – serious, conventional, mysterious, sexy, sophisticated

When adding color to a design, start with one color first and match up follow on
colors from there. A good site to find great colors to work with and color
pairings is Dribbble. You can explore designs by color on the Dribbble site
through the Explore menu. Each design also shows a color palette used in the
design and each color in the palette is clickable to bring up designs with that
color.

## Tips & Trick ##

rounded corners

* smaller is classier (3, 4, 5 px radius)
* all or none
* larger looks more comedic

shadows

* all shadows should go in the same direction in the UI – follow the same light
source, is the light coming from the top, side, bottom? light source at top is
common
* make them subtle

text shadows

* typically, only used on buttons
* be subtle
* go 1px above/below for pressed in/popped out look

gradients

* another place where subtlety goes a long way
* the color change should start and finish within a close color range
* all gradients should follow the same light source, same as shadows

inspiration folder – Find a location, easily accessible where you can store
screen shots of UI objects, pages or sites that you enjoy the design of. Any
time you come across something you like or find intriguing, save it to your
inspiration folder. Having a large supply of items for inspiration will be
helpful in following a path where you may be ripping off another designers work.

Following the steps and utilizing the tools above will probably not get you a
design award, but hopefully, there is enough there to get decent results on your
own.

Some of the above are tips/tricks I picked up on my own, but most of it is
straight from topics discussed and educated on in thoughtbot’s Design for
Developers class. thoughtbot sells their workshops individually for $1000+, but
you can sign up for the Learn program for $99 a month. You get a ton of value
out of the program, access to all of their in house and online classes,
membership newsletter with tips and tricks, all ebooks they have authored,
access to a private campfire group to answer any and all questions and much
more.
