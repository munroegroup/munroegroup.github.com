At work today, a colleague emailed our team asking for feedback on how to
refresh a caching system that we have in place for one of our products.
Typically, one of us responds with an email containing detailed directions. This
leads to an issue...

Emails Do Not Scale as Well as Information on a Web Page
--------------------------------------------------------
When you create an email with detailed directions on completing a task, that
email will make its way to the recipient or group of recipients on the mailing
list. You could argue that the email can be forwarded or archived for future
retrieval and potentially forwarded along to a new group. 

But, this raises a few problems:

-  the user or users that initially received the email or the sender needs to
successfully search through and find the email within their archive
collection, often taking much longer than one would expect
-  If and when the email has been retrieved, how does anyone know if that email
still contains up to date information? They don't. Best case is that another
email was sent as a follow up at some point that has updated information, and
probably another one later. Chances are, the group of these emails has only
succeeded in confusing the recipients rather than being of help, so they reply
to the initial sender and ask for new, clearer instructions that replace
anything sent previously. An endless loop occurs, continuing to negatively
impact the directions being handed around.

The Easy Fix is to Document the Details on a Web Page
-----------------------------------------------------
The next time you need to send information in email, think first if anyone else
could benefit from that information in the future who may not have asked for it
at the current time. If there is, document that information on a web page. 

If it is a personal project you are sharing with friends that does not require
privacy, information on an open source project, or maybe just a food recipe,
find any easy location on the internet to create a blog and document that
information within a blog. A blog can easily be created, and for free.

If it is work information, create a document on the company intranet, your
company has one of those, right? If they don't take it upon yourself to set up a
wiki internally or ask your IT department to help set one up.

The next time you reach for email as your tool to share information, ask
yourself, 'Would documenting this on a web page, be a better choice?' Usually,
the answer will be yes and you'll indirectly move towards internet fame.

*When writing blog posts describing how to accomplish a task to other users,
screenshots often work best in describing workflow actions. Two of the best
tools that I have found in capturing and adding colored circles, arrows, or
annonated text are listed below.*
